# Chippy
7400 bread board simulator

Chippy is a Java program with a GUI interface that lets the user simulate a logic circuit.  
The simulation has breadboards that you can plug into, chips, wires, battery, switches
and lights.  This allows students of Computer Organization lab-course to practice making
circuits without needing the physical board, chips, wires, etc..  

It started as a student project and is now offered as an Open Source resource for anyone
under the GNU GPLv3 license.  This is my FIRST open source offering, so I barely know how 
to do it.  Please help me get this out there.  There are lots of things that can be
contributed easily.
